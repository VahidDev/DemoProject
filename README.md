# About the project
This is a simple Web application for financial organization that is issuing loans to physical persons for short periods of time with reasonably high interest rates. The company is issuing loans only to the registered customers. The customer registration is out of scope currently. The goal is to enable business user to view already issued loans and to register new loans. Also there is a partner organization that is issuing loans on your behalf. They are using their own application and there is already a provided web service interface for them to register new loans.
